# Handcar

A Rack-based Ruby web framework.

> "Like Rails, if 'opinionated' meant 'non-functional.'"

I made this framework to follow along with Noah Gibb's lovely book [Rebuilding Rails](https://rebuilding-rails.com/). While I'm sure you could probably use it in production, don't.


## Getting Started

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'handcar'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install handcar
